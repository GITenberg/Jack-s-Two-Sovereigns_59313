<p class="drop-cap1">MADGE, do leave those horrid old
stockings, and let&#8217;s all have a
game at &#8216;Beggar my neighbour.&#8217;
It would keep Jem and Jack from quarrelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, unless you&#8217;ll darn them for me.
There are eight pairs, and they ought to be
done to-night ready for the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, take your chair and sit between
them, to keep them apart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of that? If Jack were
here and Jem in Australia, they&#8217;d quarrel
somehow. How industrious you are to-night,
Edie!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;I am tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as you&#8217;re the only person that&#8217;s
tired, of course it&#8217;s quite fair that you should
do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge, if you&#8217;d asked me civilly to help
you, I&#8217;d have done so in a minute, but sneering
won&#8217;t make me, you may be quite sure
of that. Why don&#8217;t you ask Bessie to do
some work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she&#8217;s younger, and it doesn&#8217;t
matter so much about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge, get me that little oil-can that
your mother uses for the sewing-machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father.... Here it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge, there&#8217;s baby crying. Run up and
rock him to sleep again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little sitting-room at 15 Buxton
Street, Denham Green, seemed a great deal
too small to hold such a family party as were
now squeezed into it, the above being a few
of the remarks flying about there at eight
o&#8217;clock in the evening. Those gathered in
this small space were all members of the
Kayll family. There was Mr. Kayll, a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
fair, bald, pleasant-looking man, who was
seated at the table with a newspaper before
him, on which were spread out tiny wheels,
screws, nuts, and cogs of yellowish metal. He
had taken the clock to pieces, as it would
not go, and was cleaning its works, not seeming
to take more notice of the hubbub than
if he were stone deaf.</p>

<p>Then there was Mrs. Kayll, a thin, worried-looking
woman, who was engaged in putting
a patch on the knee of a small and shabby
pair of tweed trousers. There was Madge,
too, a minute before, but she had gone to
baby, and the quiet, regular, &#8220;thump, thump&#8221;
of the cradle rockers could be heard in the
room overhead.</p>

<p>The others were so mixed up that it was
difficult to distinguish one from another.</p>

<p>That boy with the dark curly hair and
mischievous eyes was Jack, aged fourteen,
who earned five shillings a week by the labour
of his own hands. Beyond him, with his
elbows on the table, and his eyes intent on
the works of the clock over which his father
was busy, was Bob, his elder brother&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
no one is likely to remember all these children
without a list to look at now and then. Here
are their names, ages, and occupations.</p>

<p>Madge, aged sixteen, &#8220;mother&#8217;s help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob, aged fifteen, father&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>Jack, aged fourteen, a printer&#8217;s boy.</p>

<p>Jem, aged thirteen, errand-boy to a chemist.</p>

<p>Edie, aged twelve, school-girl.</p>

<p>Bessie, aged ten, school-girl.</p>

<p>Baby, aged five months. No occupation.</p>

<p>Now, having arrived at a clear understanding,
we can get on with the story, and there
will be no excuse for anyone mixing up Jack
with Jem, Edie with Bessie, or Madge with
the baby.</p>

<p>This was the conversation going on between
Jack and Jem.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do more work for four shillings than
you do for five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you don&#8217;t. I work twice as hard
as you do any day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say! I like that! And you told
me yesterday that you&#8217;d found time to read
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> all through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps you&#8217;ll be good enough to
tell me what you did say, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d <i>skimmed</i> it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you did; but any way,
whether you skimmed it, or whether you
read it properly, you wouldn&#8217;t have done so
when anyone was looking, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Jem, if you&#8217;re going to
lecture me, I shall just sew up your coat-sleeves
after you&#8217;re gone to sleep to-night,
and get ready some more little surprises for
you. I won&#8217;t be lectured by my youngers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do be quiet and not quarrel, you two
boys,&#8221; interrupted their mother in a plaintive
tone, as she held up her needle between herself
and the lamp, the better to see its eye.
&#8220;It does worry me so. You&#8217;ve given me
quite a headache.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was silent at once. Not so Jem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we, mother?&#8221; he said quickly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry. But I can&#8217;t help quarrelling
with Jack. He doesn&#8217;t give me any peace.
Now this morning I went all the way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shop with a ticket pinned on the back of my
jacket, with &#8216;This side up, with care&#8217; on it,
and Jack says that&#8217;s to teach me to brush it
before I put it on. And yesterday all my
pockets were sewn up, to teach me to keep
my hands out of them. It doesn&#8217;t. It makes
me put them in all the more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said Mrs. Kayll severely, &#8220;don&#8217;t
do that sort of thing any more. I forbid it.
Jokes of that kind may be very funny to you,
but they often lead to serious consequences.
And it&#8217;s not for you to teach Jem what he
ought to do, except by setting him a good
example.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Jack was silent. He loved teasing
and playing tricks, especially on Jem, and
was continually getting into grief by this
means.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t stop at Graves&#8217;s long,&#8221; said the
younger boy soon after in a low tone to his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very stupid of you, then. You don&#8217;t
know when you&#8217;ve got a good place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know when I&#8217;ve got a bad one, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; said Jack, who had an uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
habit of telling people the exact
truth to their faces, &#8220;you are jealous of me
because I get five shillings a week, and you
only get four.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jem turned of an indignant scarlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not! I wouldn&#8217;t be in your shoes
for a pound a week, if I knew it; so now,
then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you would be very selfish, for a
pound a week would make you able to help
mother ever so much&mdash;buy your own clothes
and all sorts of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you boys! you boys!&#8221; sighed Mrs.
Kayll. &#8220;Father, did you ever hear anything
like them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like them! Oh, dear, yes, lots of times,&#8221;
he answered in a preoccupied tone, without
looking up from his work. &#8220;My brother
Tom and I were just as bad at their age.
I recollect, though,&#8221; he added, glancing at his
boys for a minute with a twinkle in one eye,
&#8220;that my father used to cane us both soundly,
and send us to our bed-rooms till we apologized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but we&#8217;ll apologize without that,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cried Jack laughing. &#8220;Jem, old chap, shake
hands, and never mind my fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jem was quite ready, and there was peace
between them for perhaps half an hour.</p>

<p>But though the boys were quiet, the girls
were not. Edith and Bessie were at this
moment engaged in a playful and good-tempered
struggle for the possession of a
worn-out doll, which means that the one who
had it in her hand was running round the
room, jumping over chairs, or scrambling
under the table, with the other catching at
her frock or pinafore amid deafening shrieks
of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, children! Play quietly,&#8221; said Mrs.
Kayll, and the noise stopped for a minute,
only to go on again a little later.</p>

<p>At this point Madge walked in again with
the baby in its night-dress on her arm, wide
awake, and in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t go to sleep, mother, and
no wonder, so I&#8217;ve brought him down, the
sweet darling pet. And did he want to
come down-stairs and see all the fun? He
should, then, that he should, a chickums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and sissy will nurse him while she darns the
stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she sat down in her old place, and
tried to mend the great holes worn by the
boys in the heels of their hose, with the little
one on her lap jumping, kicking, writhing,
and running great risk of being pricked by
Madge&#8217;s long needle.</p>

<p>Upon this Bessie, a rather pale, fragile-looking
little creature, with great thoughtful
gray eyes, left the rough play of which she
was already growing tired, and set herself to
interest and amuse her baby brother, talking
nonsense to him, building up houses of cotton-reels
on the table, and letting him knock
them over, tickling him, kissing his fat cheeks,
until he laughed aloud, and made remarks in
his own language, such as &#8220;Boo, google,
coo-coo,&#8221; which singular words little Bessie
seemed perfectly to understand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Edie had drawn a chair to the
table, and was quite absorbed in a book
which she had read at least six times before,
and Jack was behind her, secretly pinning
her dress to the legs of the chair, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
feat he completely succeeded without arousing
suspicion. He then strolled round looking
for some fresh diversion, which was
easily found. A couple of metal buttons
were lying near Mrs. Kayll&#8217;s elbow, ready
for placing on the garment she was mending.
Jack possessed himself of these, and in two
seconds they had gone down Jem&#8217;s back,
and the culprit had to escape from the room
to get away from his brother&#8217;s vengeance.
Jem dashed after, and the scuffle was soon
heard going on overhead.</p>

<p>They were a noisy, merry, poor and unlucky
family. Loving one another dearly
at the bottom of their hearts, but hiding
their love as though it were a crime, quarrelling
a good deal, and causing much
anxiety to Mrs. Kayll, who used to think
sometimes that no woman ever had children
so hard to manage and so little time for
managing them. For Mr. Kayll, though he
was the best of husbands and kindest of
fathers, and worked hard all his life, had
not the gift of &#8220;getting on in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all startled into looking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from their various employments by a loud
imperative knock at the door.</p>

<p>Madge and the baby went to answer it,
and voices were at once heard that sounded
more energetic than polite. Before many
minutes had passed the girl came back,
rather red in the face, and with a paper in
her disengaged hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the baker,&#8221; she said in an undertone,
so as not to be heard in the passage. &#8220;He
has brought his bill, and he&#8217;s so rude, and
says he won&#8217;t bring us any more bread unless
he&#8217;s paid to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; asked her father, taking
the account from her and looking at the
amount. &#8220;As it happens, I can do it.
Here, Madge, pay him, make him receipt it,
get rid of him, and tell him he needn&#8217;t
trouble to call again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge took the money and did as she
was told. But she stood for a minute in
the passage after he was gone, before she
rejoined the others, and brushed something
from her eyelashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, baby,&#8221; she whispered, pressing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
face to the cool little cheek. &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>miserable</i>
to be poor. I think there&#8217;s nothing more
wretched in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that sentiment all her brothers and
sisters would have agreed. They had had
few other troubles, and therefore fancied
there was nothing so bad as the want of
money.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MOTHER,&#8221; said Madge, as she and Mrs.
Kayll were making the beds on the
next Monday morning, &#8220;I wish you would
talk to Jem. He is determined to leave his
place, and it does seem such a pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave!&#8221; cried Mrs. Kayll, stopping in
the act of shaking up a pillow. &#8220;Why, I
thought he liked it so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he did at first, but he&#8217;s tired of it
already, just as he always is, after a month
or so.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Mrs. Kayll sighed wearily, and laid the
pillow in its place, taking care that the hole
in the much-patched cover should go underneath
and out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiresome boy! He is so unsettled. I&#8217;ll
talk to him to-night; but it&#8217;s not much good
when he has once taken a dislike to his
work. He&#8217;ll never go on with it with any
pleasure. I don&#8217;t know what would become
of us if Jack were the same. Heigh-ho! You
children are a constant anxiety to me. We
really can&#8217;t afford to have Jem at home on
our hands just now, when your father&#8217;s doing
so badly&mdash;really I don&#8217;t think he ever did so
badly before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; said Madge thoughtfully, straightening
the patchwork quilt, made long since
by her own hands, &#8220;Jem is so good in his
way, and seems much more fond of us all
than either Bob or Jack, and plays with the
children without teasing them like Jack does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a dear affectionate boy,&#8221; sighed
her mother, &#8220;but I wish his affection made
him consider us a little more and himself a
little less.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>At this point, as they had finished the
bed they were making, Madge picked up the
baby&mdash;who had been sitting in a corner all
the time, contentedly sucking a knob which
had come off a chest of drawers, and looking
on at his mother and sister while they were
busy&mdash;and conveyed him into the next room,
where he had again to sit with his back to the
wall and amuse himself as well as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Don&#8217;t get unhappy about
it, mother dear,&#8221; said Madge in her quiet
philosophical way. &#8220;As long as we&#8217;re all
well, that&#8217;s the chief thing, isn&#8217;t it? Being
poor isn&#8217;t half so bad as being ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>From which it will be seen that, like most
other people, Madge saw the world with
quite different eyes when she was fresh and
bright in the morning, from those with which
she looked at it when she was tired and
depressed at night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s all very well for you, child,&#8221; said
her mother, who seemed to think poverty
was quite bad enough, as she looked at the
girl&#8217;s worn blue dress, and remembered how
hard it had been to make the children look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
anything like respectable for church yesterday&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s
all very well for you, but when
you come to my age you will wish you too
had a little leisure, and need not grind,
grind, slave and pinch from year&#8217;s end to
year&#8217;s end. But there, Madgie, it&#8217;s of no
use grumbling. I don&#8217;t really mind, only I
get tired of it now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she smiled, and then sighed as a few
more disagreeable reflections came crowding
into her mind. Her husband&#8217;s coat was very
very shabby, and he ought to have another,
just to keep up his character in his business.
The coals were getting low, too, and the
summer was drawing to its close; there was
no saying how soon the days might turn
cold. And there was very little food in the
larder. She must really turn her thoughts
to providing dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge,&#8221; she said suddenly, &#8220;your father
has a sale to-day, and won&#8217;t be home to
dinner, so we&#8217;ll not cook anything but some
potatoes, because there&#8217;s a jar of nice beef
dripping, and you all like potatoes and dripping.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; Madge answered, apparently
scarcely giving the matter a thought.</p>

<p>It was well for Mrs. Kayll that her eldest
daughter was so amiable and easy of disposition.
Nothing came wrong to Madge. She
took life quietly, with a kind of stolid good-temper,
and was one of those people of whom
everyone else expects a great deal, and gets
it, without being surprised, or particularly
grateful. She worked hard from morning
to night, uncomplainingly, and it was not
until she was very tired, and had more on
her hands than she could do, that she was
sometimes led into speaking a little sharply
to her young brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Ever since she left off going to school,
Madge had been nurse, cook, needlewoman,
and in part teacher, for in so large a family
as this, where no servant could be kept,
there was always more than enough employment
for both her mother and herself, with
keeping the house tidy, everyone&#8217;s clothes
clean and in good repair, preparing meals
and clearing them away, and taking care of
the baby.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>The children who were at school came in
for their simple dinner, and ran off again;
the afternoon was passed in the same way
as usual, with washing up, straightening,
and making all comfortable and ready for
tea.</p>

<p>To this meal Jack, Jem, and the three
girls came home, but Mr. Kayll and Bob
were not expected until nine or ten. So the
mother poured out tea, and Madge cut bread
and dripping for everybody with untiring
patience.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the meal, Jem
remarked in a matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jem, you don&#8217;t mean that!&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Kayll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, though; but don&#8217;t you bother about
it, mother, I&#8217;ll soon get something else to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jem, you&#8217;re a&mdash;&#8221; began Jack hotly; but
his mother touched his lips with her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call him names, whatever he&#8217;s
done, Jack. That won&#8217;t do any good. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
oh, Jem, it is too bad if you have, when you
know how poor we are, and how little your
father has had to do lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see, mother,&#8221; said Jem,
with a rather superior smile, &#8220;I mean to get
something better, so that I shall be more real
help. I&#8217;m sure I ought to be making more
than four shillings a week, and I believe I
can if you leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; put in Edie, who always believed
in Jem, and took his part against the whole
world, &#8220;he&#8217;ll soon find a better place, where
he&#8217;ll get on&mdash;won&#8217;t you, dear? And he has
stayed in this one a month now&mdash;that&#8217;s longer
than he was last time, and next time he&#8217;ll
stay longer still.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack gave a sort of grunt that seemed to
express disapproval, and the matter dropped
until Bob came in a couple of hours later,
very tired and not in the best of tempers in
consequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s coming directly, mother,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have anything till he comes
in, and then we&#8217;ll have a bit of supper together.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>He sat down, and Bessie, the smallest and
palest of the girls, climbed on his knee, and
slipped her arm under his and round his
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, monster,&#8221; he said, for this was his
nickname for the slight little creature, &#8220;how
have you been getting on? Any news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;except that Jem&#8217;s left
his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Left? What, have they sent him off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He left of his own accord. He was
tired of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s a miserable, selfish, stupid, useless
creature, and for two pins I&#8217;d give him a
thorough thrashing,&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Do you
hear that, Jem?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge tried to check his anger, as her
mother was not in the room, but he would
not listen to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Madgie,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I shall let him
hear the truth for once in his life, as father&#8217;s
so easy with him. He doesn&#8217;t deserve to
have a home to come to when he behaves as
he does, caring more for whether he likes his
work, or whether he doesn&#8217;t, than for seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mother slave till she&#8217;s ready to drop. Do
you think she <i>likes</i> toiling from morning to
night to keep us all respectable and comfortable,
or that father <i>likes</i> shouting himself
hoarse all day before he can make people buy
things for half what they&#8217;re worth, or that
Madge enjoys sweeping the stairs and washing
up the sauce-pans, or even that Jack or I
like our work? You&#8217;re the only one that
doesn&#8217;t seem to think it&#8217;s possible to do what
you ought, whether you like it or not. You
seem to think you were put into the world
to enjoy yourself, no matter how inconvenient
that may be for other people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jem looked very cast-down, for he was
fond of Bob, and liked to have his good
opinion. Edie put in a word for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too hard on him, Bob. He&#8217;s
much younger than you, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible to be too hard,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m thoroughly ashamed of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Kayll re-entered the
room, and directly after the head of the
family arrived, Madge having only just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
finished setting the bread and cheese and
cold bacon in readiness. Mr. Kayll was
evidently tired out after the day&#8217;s hard work,
but he had a smile and a nod for each of the
young people in turn, and a kiss for his wife,
who went to the door to meet him.</p>

<p>While he and his eldest boy ate their supper,
Madge put the baby off to sleep in his
cradle, and the three little girls said good-night
and went to bed, Edie whispering to
Jem as she passed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, old boy, so long as father
isn&#8217;t angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were gone Mr. Kayll took out
his purse, which he handed to Jack, with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give that to your mother, Jacky. That&#8217;ll
set her up for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll poured the contents into her
hand and counted ten sovereigns.</p>

<p>&#8220;All for me?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is. Make much of it. There&#8217;s
no saying when the next will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack took the empty purse to give back to
his father, and turned it over in his hands,
squeezing it, and pretending to try to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
some stray coin that had been overlooked,
but really slipping into it two sovereigns of
his own, which he had held in his hand for
some time, looking out for an opportunity of
getting them into his father&#8217;s possession
without the act being seen.</p>

<p>Poor Jack, who was generally supposed to
care very little about his family, had been
saving for a long time, depriving himself of
anything he could so as to put a little aside
from his weekly earnings, and had at last
been unable longer to resist the temptation
of giving Mr. Kayll a surprise. Yet his face
expressed nothing as he handed back the
purse, which his father weighed in his hand
with mock grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feels terribly light again,&#8221; he said, returning
it to his pocket as he believed
empty.</p>

<p>Jack laughed inwardly, imagining the expression
of his father&#8217;s face when he should
find the money, and be unable to guess
whence it had come. He controlled his
mouth, and kept a serious face then, but once
or twice afterwards during the evening a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
stifled chuckle proceeded from him, the
meaning of which no one could discover.</p>

<p>Madge had come down again and was just
about to put the food away, when there came
a timid knock at the front door.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>RELATIONS.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THAT doesn&#8217;t sound like a creditor with
a bill to-night,&#8221; said Mr. Kayll, laughing
and rubbing his hands softly over his
knees. &#8220;But if so, mother&#8217;s ready for him.&#8221;
And he slapped his pocket meaningly. &#8220;Jack,
my boy, you go and open. Your sister looks
as though she&#8217;d done about enough for to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack obeyed. He opened the door rather
doubtfully a little way to begin with, and
then, hearing and seeing nothing, somewhat
wider, when he saw before him a small girl,
apparently about as old as his sister Edie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>He looked at her, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked, after
waiting a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Kayll live here?&#8221; she inquired
then in a voice that trembled with nervousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Come in,&#8221; said Jack gruffly,
and she stepped timidly inside, when he shut
the door behind her and put his head into
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little girl wants to speak to you, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little girl! What little girl? What&#8217;s
her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask her then, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack&#8217;s head disappeared, but reappeared
almost directly, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy Coleson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coleson!&#8221; repeated his father with a start
of surprise. &#8220;Tell her to come in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the next instant Jack ushered in the
visitor, who looked at the floor and seemed
dazzled by the lamp-light which showed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to be a pretty child with soft yellow hair and
fair white skin, but poorly or rather miserably
clad in a black frock worn through at
the elbows and in many a place beside. She
was so thin in the face, too, that it was quite
painful to look at her.</p>

<p>Mr. Kayll took her by the hand, drew her
to him, and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is a surprise!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Little
Amy Coleson! Grown exactly like her
mother, too, only thinner. Jack, bring her a
chair. Mother, isn&#8217;t she like what Amy used
to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Mrs. Kayll, resting one hand
on her husband&#8217;s shoulder, and thoughtfully
looking at the child. &#8220;Dear, dear, how time
flies! It must be eight years since we saw
her last. Boys, you&#8217;ve heard of your father&#8217;s
cousin Amy. This is her little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where have you dropped from?&#8221;
Mr. Kayll asked next. &#8220;What brings you
to us alone at nearly nine o&#8217;clock at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother was afraid I shouldn&#8217;t find you
at home if I came earlier,&#8221; said the child,
nervously twisting her hands together, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
letting her large blue eyes wander from one
to another of the wondering faces around her,
for Madge and Jem were staring at her without
disguise, and Bob and Jack stole furtive
glances every now and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how is mother?&#8221; Mr. Kayll asked,
beginning to have some suspicion as to the
meaning of this visit. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t even heard
from her for years and years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not very well. She never is very
well,&#8221; was the shy answer. &#8220;She always has
such a bad cough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father died a long time ago,&#8221; she said
simply, with a downward glance at her shabby
and ragged black frock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead! Dear me! Tut, tut, tut!&#8221; said
Mr. Kayll, very much shocked. &#8220;Poor child!
Poor little woman! that&#8217;s very sad. Dear
me!&#8221; he repeated, while his wife looked at
the wan little figure until the tears came
into her eyes. As for Madge, not being able
to show her sympathy in any other way, she
sat down and drew her little cousin on to her
knee.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8220;Mother sent me,&#8221; said Amy Coleson from
that perch as she gathered more courage, &#8220;to
ask you if you would lend us a little money,
because we are so dreadfully poor, and&mdash;and
baby&#8217;s so ill;&#8221; here her voice trembled, but
she recovered herself directly and went on,
&#8220;and we can&#8217;t get her anything she ought
to have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Kayll looked grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old is the baby?&#8221; his wife asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three; but she can&#8217;t walk yet. She has
never been strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something very old and womanly
about Amy&#8217;s way of saying this that showed
plainly how she was her mother&#8217;s companion
and help, and had lost her childishness in
the anxiety of needing money, an anxiety
that makes children old before they are grown
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how many more of you are there?&#8221;
Mrs. Kayll inquired, as her husband seemed
to be still thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Kitty,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s all;
mother and Kitty, baby and me. Kitty&#8217;s only
four.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;What have you been living on since you
lost your father, my dear?&#8221; Mr. Kayll asked,
suddenly looking up, for he had been staring
very hard at the boards of the floor where
they were visible through a hole in the carpet.</p>

<p>The little girl coloured faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother used to take sewing, but she has
been so ill and so busy nursing baby that she
hasn&#8217;t been able to do any. We haven&#8217;t had
any money lately except what I&#8217;ve earned,
but we can do with <i>very</i> little,&#8221; she concluded
pathetically. And then guessing at the
question that was coming, she added: &#8220;I&#8217;m
a model.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sit for painters to draw and paint me,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;when they want me, but that isn&#8217;t
always, and the last week or two I haven&#8217;t
been wanted at all. And mother thought
perhaps you&#8217;d help us a little until&mdash;until&mdash;I
get something to do again, or mother is
better and can take in sewing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Kayll stared at the boards again for a
few minutes in silence. The child&#8217;s story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was a sad one undoubtedly, yet how could
he help her with such a large family of his
own? But again, when he compared the
round healthy faces of his children with that
of this pale sharp-featured little creature, and
reflected that she was fatherless, and had already
to support others by her own efforts,
he felt that he could not refuse her request.
Fatherless! What would become of his little
ones had they not him to work for them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge,&#8221; he said rising, &#8220;get the girl a
sandwich. She must be hungry after her
journey. By the way, where do you come
from? Where do you live now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Wingate Row, Bacton,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not going back there to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I am!&#8221; she said quickly. &#8220;I
must. It isn&#8217;t much after nine, and it&#8217;s only
half an hour&#8217;s walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He asked her one or two more questions,
then giving his wife a look that she understood,
he led the way from the room, she
following, when they had a little private conversation
in the kitchen, leaving the visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to eat the sandwiches Madge brought her,
and to be stared at by the wondering boys.</p>

<p>In the kitchen five pounds passed back
into Mr. Kayll&#8217;s purse, as a result of the few
words with his wife. Then they both returned
and found Amy Coleson standing up,
apparently anxious to be gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my child,&#8221; said Mr. Kayll. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
take you home and talk to your mother myself;
that will be the best way. When you&#8217;re
ready I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>She coloured up to the roots of her hair
with pleasure, for she had begun to think her
visit was to have no result at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready now,&#8221; she said, raising her
face to kiss first Madge, then Mrs. Kayll, and
then laying her hand confidingly in his.
&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; and she glanced at the rest with
a nod that was meant for them all at once,
and began to move towards the door. Mr.
Kayll lingered only to say good-night to the
children, as they would be in bed before his
return, and looked round at their bright faces
with a smile. It was a pleasant picture, one
that he would perhaps have looked at yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
once more if he had known that he would
never enter that room again.</p>

<p>The next minute he and the child were
gone. Then began a buzz of talk and wonderment,
and Madge cleared away the supper-things
with her head so full of other thoughts
that she nearly put the cheese into the bread-pan
and the loaf away on the same dish with
the bacon.</p>

<small>HELP IN NEED.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS Mr. Kayll and Amy Coleson walked towards
Bacton, the little girl found her
voice, and talked away fast enough in a
sober old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>&#8220;We live in lodgings, you know, and we
owe lots of rent, but Mrs. Smith is so kind,
and says she doesn&#8217;t mind waiting a bit
longer, and she knows we&#8217;ll pay it as soon as
we can; and sometimes she brings us a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
beef-tea for baby, only not very often, because
mother don&#8217;t much like it, and she
don&#8217;t let her know how poor we are. Mother
can&#8217;t bear for anyone to know. When father
was alive it was quite different. I remember
it very well; we lived at Barnes then, and
there was only Kitty beside me until a little
while after father died, and then baby came.
She&#8217;s such a dear little thing with light yellow
hair, and talks as plainly as I do nearly,
and so patient&mdash;oh, she is so patient! But
she can&#8217;t walk. We&#8217;ve tried so hard to teach
her to walk, and once when she was stronger
she nearly could, but then she got weaker
afterwards and forgot it all again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Kayll was silently musing over this,
noticing how the child always said &#8220;we,&#8221; as
though she and her mother went together
in everything, when a kind of sniff made him
look down, and the light from the next gaslamp
showed him that his little companion
was quietly crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, my dear,&#8221; he said kindly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? We&#8217;ll hope that the worst
of your troubles are over now, though I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
know that I can help you much. Still, I&#8217;ll
do what I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy hastened to dry her wet eyes, as
though ashamed of the tears, gulped down
a sob, and in a few minutes spoke as cheerfully
as at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;You all looked so happy and so bright
and comfortable at your home. Such a lot
of you, too! It must be nice to have brothers.
And that big girl, too; I did like <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on again without talking.
Mr. Kayll would almost have forgotten his
little friend but for the hand holding so
tightly to his, and all the more tightly when
they met some noisy party of men arm in
arm, shouting and singing as they came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you tired, my dear?&#8221; asked Mr.
Kayll after a while, as he felt that she lagged
slightly behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; she answered, quickening her
steps for a few minutes, but gradually falling
back into her old weary walk, dragging her
unwilling feet along, with her shoes, much too
large, flapping the pavement at every step. &#8220;I
have been out all day, and it&#8217;s getting so late.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>And as she grew more tired she ceased to
chatter. On and on they went along the
broad road crowded with foot-passengers,
past the shops that were still open and
brilliant with flaring gas-jets. Once more
only before they reached their destination
Amy spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny,&#8221; she said, looking up at
her companion, &#8220;to see all these shops and
the heaps of people, and to hear them shouting
and laughing, and then just to lift up
your eyes and there are the stars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Mr. Kayll without thinking
about it, for he had other matters on his
mind; and if he had thought about it, it
would have seemed to him the most natural
thing that the stars should be overhead all
the time.</p>

<p>Amy was silent. It was her private belief
that everything was very strange&mdash;the world,
the people in it, and the sky above; but no
one she knew seemed to look upon it in quite
the same light.</p>

<p>On and on, then suddenly to the right, and
down a darker street for some distance, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to the left, up a narrower turning, and Amy
stopped and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Wingate Row, and here is our
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>And a few minutes later Mr. Kayll was in
a poorly-furnished room talking to a thin
haggard-looking young widow, who was sitting
beside a bed on which lay the sick baby
with a face as white as the pillow. In the
mixed pleasure and sadness of meeting his
cousin again after so long an interval, and in
such a way, he had no eyes to spare for anything
else, and did not see the loving way in
which little old-fashioned Amy bent over the
invalid, softly kissing her, and whispering,
&#8220;How are you, baby dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>She kneeled by the bed, holding the tiny
white fingers, and doubling them up or
opening them out, half playfully, half in
forgetfulness of what she was doing, as
she talked in a low voice meant only for
baby&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, my darling, you&#8217;ll soon be
better, you know. Very, very soon. Shall I
tell you where I&#8217;ve been? I&#8217;ve seen a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
boys, and such a nice girl. They called her
Madge. Madge! What a funny name, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was she like?&#8221; lisped the little
thing, twining her fingers in her sister&#8217;s wavy
yellow hair, and softly pulling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big. Not pretty, but with kind eyes,
and she kissed me, and made me sit on her
knee as though I had been as little as you,
baby. And she gave me some supper, and
was so nice. I wish you could see her. She
didn&#8217;t talk much. I don&#8217;t remember that
she said anything at all. It was only her
way of looking, and holding my hand, and
smiling. And there was a big solemn boy,
and a smaller one, and a smaller one still.
I suppose Kitty has been in bed ever so long,
hasn&#8217;t she?&#8221; And she glanced towards the
door of a small inner room that opened out
of this one.</p>

<p>The baby nodded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a long, earnest conversation
was going on behind them between their
mother and Mr. Kayll. The children did
not hear what was said, for it was carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in undertones, but the chink of coins reached
their ears, and Amy&#8217;s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we had plenty of money, baby, how
happy we could be, couldn&#8217;t we? But perhaps
we shouldn&#8217;t be as fond of each other
then as we are now; do you think we should?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, fonder,&#8221; said the tiny invalid,
still playing with her sister&#8217;s curls that fell
forward on the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t so much wish to be very rich, and
to have carriages and all sorts of beautiful
things,&#8221; Amy went on dreamily, &#8220;but, oh
dear! I should like always to be able to earn
money if I worked hard, and to bring it home
to you and mother and Kitty. But there
isn&#8217;t any work to do. I believe the beggars,
and the organ-grinders, and the girls selling
flowers get ever so much more than we do.
Oh, baby, I think it is funny that some people
should have more money than they can possibly
spend in all their lives, and we shouldn&#8217;t
have any.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick child&#8217;s blue-veined eyelids slowly
closed. She could not understand all this,
but the low sweet murmuring talk had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
soothed her to sleep, with her fingers tangled
in the long soft hair.</p>

<p>Amy dared not move for fear of rousing
her, and continued to kneel there in silence
with her eyes fixed on the sleeping face.
Poor baby! Was it likely that she would ever
get strong and healthy, here in this narrow,
crowded court, where no fresh air ever seemed
to come, and very little sunshine was to be
seen? Would she not linger on month after
month, perhaps year after year, a weak little
cripple, who must be carried or wheeled about
always, for want of air and sunlight and good
things now, before it was too late?</p>

<p>As she wondered in her old, old way, the
voices of her mother and Mr. Kayll buzzed
on until the buzz became fainter and fainter,
as though it were getting further and further
away, until it was inaudible in the far distance.</p>

<p>Amy&#8217;s head had sunk on the bed, and she
was fast asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>&#8220;STOP THIEF!&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MR. KAYLL had heard the whole long,
sad story of the struggles of his cousin,
Mrs. Coleson, to keep her children and herself
from starving. He believed that even now
she would not have asked for help, but that
the illness of her youngest child and her own
failing strength had compelled her to do so
much against her will. There was no one
else to whom she could go, for her only other
relation, Mr. Coleson&#8217;s mother, although she
was well off, was a very hard and proud old
lady, who had long ago refused to have anything
more to do with her daughter-in-law.
In consequence, though he could ill afford it,
Mr. Kayll lent her five pounds that he had
intended for the use of his own family. With
that sum the widow would be able to get on
for a while, and he could only hope that she
would never be brought quite so low again.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he said, as he rose to go, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
glanced at Amy as she slept with her head
on her tiny sister&#8217;s pillow, &#8220;you have there
a good and helpful little girl, who must be a
great comfort to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Coleson smiled rather sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is of more use than many a grown-up
person,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Poor Amy! It
has been a hard life for her. She has scarcely
known what it is to be a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then farewell for the present was said
without disturbing the sleepers, and Mr. Kayll
stood once more out under the stars. It was
now half an hour after midnight. He heard
a clock strike as he started homewards, feeling
very sad and grave for him, for he was
a man who was nearly always cheerful, even
under circumstances that would have made
most other people sit down and sigh over the
hardness of their fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor things!&#8221; he said to himself more
than once as he went. &#8220;How altered! Poor
Amy!&#8221; And by Amy he meant not the little
girl but her mother, whom he had long ago
known as a merry happy child, without a
care or trouble in the world. It was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
wonder Mr. Kayll wished for once in his life
with all his heart that he were rich, that he
might put poverty and want away from these
poor relations of his for ever.</p>

<p>The appearance of the streets had quite
changed since he came. The shops were now
shut, and the foot-passengers had nearly all
gone. Only the policeman was still on his
beat, and a few stray late people were hurrying
home to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Kayll thought of his wife sitting up
tired and half asleep, and wondering what
kept him so long, and this thought made
him hasten his steps more and more until he
was almost running.</p>

<p>All at once, as he was passing a closed shop,
the door was suddenly thrown open, and a
man dashed swiftly by him. Without noticing
this much, he was keeping up his own steady
trot, when he heard someone else running
behind him, and the next instant a big
powerful man had caught hold of him by
the collar, and a voice said in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got one of you at any rate! Police!
Thieves!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Mr. Kayll tried to shake off his grasp, but
he found this was impossible, so gave up the
attempt and stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! What do you mean? What&#8217;s
the matter?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>But the man, who had no hat on, and was
not completely dressed, shouted again loudly,
&#8220;Police! Thieves!&#8221; while, unseen by either
of them, a third man crept out of the same
shop-door, and glided quietly away in the
opposite direction. Then two policemen
came up, and much to his astonishment and
anger Mr. Kayll was given into custody.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absurd!&#8221; he said indignantly. &#8220;Why,
I haven&#8217;t twopence about me anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he might say what he liked; it was
all of no use. The man without a hat declared
that he had broken into his shop, in
company with another man who had escaped.</p>

<p>And this is the paragraph that came out
in the papers afterwards:</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Kayll was charged with being
concerned, with another man not in custody,
in burglariously breaking and entering 4050
Queen Street, Bacton, and stealing two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sovereigns, the property of Henry Brown,
jeweller. Henry Brown, of 4050 Queen
Street, said he saw the house closed on
Monday night at half-past eleven o&#8217;clock.
At about ten minutes to one he was disturbed
by a noise down-stairs, and saw two
men walking out of the street door. The
prisoner was one of the two men. Witness
ran after them, caught hold of the prisoner,
and called out &#8216;Police.&#8217; The other man ran
away. He held on to prisoner till the police
arrived, when he gave him into custody.
Witness then examined the premises, and
found that a cash-desk had been broken open,
and that four pounds had been taken. Two
of the missing sovereigns were found on the
prisoner.&mdash;The prisoner said he was passing
the door, and the prosecutor ran out and
caught him. He had no idea how the two
sovereigns came into his possession. He was
committed for trial.&#8221;</p>

<small>WHERE IS FATHER?</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;JEM, you had better go to bed, and you
too, Jack. It&#8217;s very late, and I don&#8217;t
suppose father will be home before twelve.
A quarter past eleven! That&#8217;s too late for
all of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Kayll who spoke, looking first
at the clock and then round at her sleepy
children. Madge was nodding, Bob stifling
a yawn, and Jack and Jem both appeared
much too wide-awake to be natural.</p>

<p>Jem made a grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, do let us stay and hear all about
it,&#8221; he said in imploring tones.</p>

<p>Jack, however, rose at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, mother; good-night.&#8221; And
he went straight upstairs in the dark, for
candles by which to see to undress were a
luxury not indulged in by the Kayll children.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well for Jack to go, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
know, mother,&#8221; said Jem, who was not inclined
to yield without an argument, &#8220;because
he has to be up early and off to work;
but I haven&#8217;t, until I get something else to
do, so I may just as well sit up and keep
you company. Send Bob and Madge instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll looked up with a slight smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any company, thank you,&#8221;
she told him. &#8220;I get quite as much as I
need&mdash;rather too much, sometimes. And I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good for you to be up till
twelve, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt me for once,&#8221; said the boy
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you go to bed when mother
tells you?&#8221; muttered Bob, who was preparing
to go himself. &#8220;What&#8217;s the good of bothering
her and making such a fuss?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jem fired up angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You be quiet, Bob. Nobody spoke to
you. I may stay, mayn&#8217;t I, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; repeated Mrs. Kayll firmly,
shaking her head. &#8220;Go to bed, all of you,
and get a good rest, ready for the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to-morrow. Father will be tired, and I&#8217;m
sure he&#8217;d a great deal rather find you all gone
and the house quiet. Do go, there&#8217;s good
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge folded up her work, kissed her, and
went. Bob followed her example; but still
Jem lingered, sitting so silent that his
mother thought he had gone, and sewed on
industriously until some slight sound he
made caused her to start and look up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Jem! What has come over you?
You heard what I said a few minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;d really mind,
mother. Besides, I want to tell father about
leaving Mr. Graves&#8217;s, and to ask him what
I&#8217;d better do next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jem! How thoughtless you are, to be
sure! Now, do you think, when father
comes in tired, as he certainly will be, between
twelve and one at night, he will want
to be worried by your affairs? There, no
more, Jem. Go along at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very slowly and reluctantly, and wearing
a sulky expression which meant that he
thought himself ill-used, Jem departed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
though all the time he was so sleepy he had
hardly been able to hold his eyes open for a
quarter of an hour past.</p>

<p>Edith and Bessie were sleeping soundly
when Madge went up. She stood for a few
minutes looking at them, as they lay side by
side, for there was enough moonlight to show
their faces quite plainly to eyes that had
grown accustomed to the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;How pretty they are like that!&#8221; thought
Madge, with an elder sister&#8217;s affection.
&#8220;What dear little things they are too, in
spite of their faults, when one comes to think
about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she undressed, said her prayers, and
crept in beside Bessie, so weary after seventeen
hours of hard toil that almost as soon as
her head touched the pillow she was in a
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>Before long the whole house was wrapped
in a peaceful stillness, as one after another
of its occupants lay down and forgot all
fatigues, anxieties, longings for money, aches
and pains, in pleasant visions or calm unconsciousness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>And the poor mother down-stairs? She
drew the lamp nearer, now that there was no
one else to share its light, and stitched away
at her mending, the click of her needle on the
thimble being almost as regular as the &#8220;tick-tack&#8221;
of the little clock on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Ungrateful little clock that it was! It
had always been treated well and kindly,
and wound up every night, in spite of its not
telling the exact truth, and now Mr. Kayll
had just cleaned it, oiled its works, and set
it going again; yet, such is the ingratitude of
clocks, it set itself to work to make poor
Mrs. Kayll uncomfortable, by compelling
her to notice how fast the time was going.
It would not even strike twelve quietly, but
gave a warning growl first, to attract her attention,
and then hammered out twelve distinct
&#8220;tings,&#8221; that sounded twice as loud as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be here soon,&#8221; said Mrs. Kayll,
taking a fresh needleful of cotton, and trying
to go on with her work; but somehow or
other the needle would not go in at the
right place, and Mrs. Kayll&#8217;s head drooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
forward slowly more and more, until her
chin rested upon her breast.</p>

<p>She, too, was asleep. The clock at once
seized this opportunity, and rushed on as
fast as it could go, the big hand hurrying
round its face and the little one creeping
steadily after. Half-past twelve. She did
not move. The hands hurried on, and suddenly
the tired mother started awake, roused
by a loud warning sound, in time to hear it
strike &#8220;One.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; she exclaimed, springing
to her feet, rubbing her eyes and staring
hard at the clock, before she could believe.
&#8220;One! How late he is! I must have been
nodding.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked up and down the room a few
times, to wake herself more thoroughly; and
then again tried to go on with her work,
thinking meanwhile of the little girl and her
sad story.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are keeping him long,&#8221; she said to
herself; &#8220;but there&#8217;s no saying how much
worse he may have found matters than he
expected. Possibly they are in such great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
trouble that he cannot bring himself to leave
them. Poor Robert! How worn out he will
be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stitch, stitch. And then the drowsiness
came back, and the clock made haste, and
succeeded in striking two without waking
her. She awoke, though, at a quarter past
the hour, put away her work, and walked to
the door to stand looking out into the
street.</p>

<p>It is very painful to wait and wait for
someone you expect, who does not come.
At first you are surprised, then astonished,
then you begin to be anxious, after which,
if the expected person is one for whom you
care much, you become seriously frightened,
and imagine every terrible thing that could
possibly have come to pass.</p>

<p>So it was with Mrs. Kayll. At three
o&#8217;clock she fancied her husband must have
been run over, or have met with some other
accident, and before long she determined to
wait no longer, but to go out and look for
him.</p>

<p>She went upstairs, the first thing, bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
over the bed where Madge was sleeping, and
gently shook her by the arm. The girl
opened her eyes in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Madge! Don&#8217;t wake the others,
pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge sat upright, staring at her mother
with a bewildered expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear me, child? Are you
awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father hasn&#8217;t come home!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge stared at her still, evidently not
quite understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what time is it?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;A quarter past three or more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to dress quickly and come
down, so that you could open the door if I
should miss him, and then I&#8217;m going to look
for him,&#8221; Mrs. Kayll said hurriedly, but
without raising her voice above a whisper,
so that the others slept on undisturbed.</p>

<p>Madge stepped out on to the floor and
began to put on her clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need be so frightened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mother dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So many things
might have kept him. Perhaps the baby
that the little girl said was so ill, was worse,
and father thought it would be cruel to
come away. Or the mother may be worse,
so that he could not leave the children. Or
perhaps there may be a fire somewhere, and
father is stopping to see it. You know how
fond father is of looking at fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>These solutions of the puzzle had already
occurred to Mrs. Kayll, but yet they seemed
more possible when suggested by someone
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear, it can&#8217;t do any harm for me
to go and see. The worst that can happen
is that your father may laugh at me for
being so anxious about nothing. Come
down as soon as you&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, thinking it safer, not to talk there
any longer, she went and put on bonnet and
shawl, and again took up her position at the
front door.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Madge was at her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do first, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to find the address Amy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Coleson gave us&mdash;Wingate Row&mdash;to see if
he is there, and, if not, whether he has been
there, and at what time he left. If he comes
home, Madge, tell him how it was, and that
I am sure to be in soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with these words her mother hurried
away, and the girl was left to keep lonely
watch, and to stifle her fears as well as she
could. Fortunately for her, Madge had not
such a quick imagination as her mother.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>MORNING.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was Madge&#8217;s custom to be up and have
the baby dressed at half-past six, and
breakfast ready at a quarter past seven, Mrs.
Kayll nearly always coming down about the
same time as she did, and sharing the work
of preparing the meal, though Madge used
to try to get it done without waking her.
The boys were always the next to make their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
appearance, as they had to start early for
work.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, after the night
of useless waiting and watching, the meal
was spread, the baby sitting in a corner trying
to wear some teeth through his gums
by means of a bread-crust, and Madge was
sharpening a knife ready for cutting the
bread, when Jack descended from above,
whistling as he came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning, old girl,&#8221; said he in cheery
tones. &#8220;What time did father get home?&#8221;</p>

<p>His sister was very pale, with red eyelids,
and many unmistakable signs of having cried
a great deal not long since. Jack was not
given to showing much affection&mdash;in fact he
showed so little that he was not supposed to
feel any at all. Therefore it was only &#8220;like
him&#8221; that he should simply stare at her
blankly when he observed these signs, and
say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo! What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge&#8217;s only answer was &#8220;Oh, Jack!&#8221; in
a broken voice, as she turned away her head
for a minute.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Jack still stared in wonder. Had father
not come home at all? Had&mdash;why did Madge
look so strange? All at once something much
worse than the truth flashed into his mind.
The colour left his ruddy face in an instant,
leaving it ashy white, and he stood gazing at
her, with a sudden horror turning him cold
and sick. He could not speak again, but sat
down by the table and waited for what was
to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack,&#8221; she repeated in the same half-choked
tones, &#8220;poor father!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy tried hard to ask something&mdash;&#8220;How&mdash;what&mdash;?&#8221;
and his lips parted, but
no sound came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother sat up for him till nearly half-past
three,&#8221; Madge went on, overcoming her
emotion enough to be able to cut some bread
and butter, and never dreaming for an instant
what was passing in her brother&#8217;s mind, and
what unnecessary misery she was making
him suffer. &#8220;Then she woke me, and I came
down, while she went to try and find out
what had become of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The memory of her lonely watch was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in great part what caused Madge&#8217;s voice to
tremble and her eyes to fill, but as Jack
knew nothing of this he was quite unprepared
for her next remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what should you think? He has
been taken up by the police for a burglar,
and is locked up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy still said nothing, for he had
hard work to keep back a burst of laughter.
Locked up! Was that all? And he had been
fancying&mdash;but here he checked himself, and
set his teeth until the desire to either laugh
or cry was gone. To Madge&#8217;s surprise he
turned on her angrily the next moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth is there in that to make
such a fuss about? I suppose they&#8217;ll soon find
out their mistake and set him at liberty again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swallowed some tea, took a bite or two
of bread and butter, and, before she had got
over her astonishment, had snatched up his
cap and run off.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an unfeeling boy!&#8221; Madge said to
herself when he was gone. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem
to care a bit for anybody. How different
from Jem!&#8221; For Madge was one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
who judge people by their manner and appearance,
and are not in the least able to see
below the surface.</p>

<p>Then down came Bob and Jem, who had
slept the night through, and were quite unprepared
to hear that anything uncommon
had happened. Madge had to explain again,
and after his first surprise was over, Bob&#8217;s
first thought was for &#8220;the mother,&#8221; as he
called her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; he asked, as she did not
make her appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I persuaded her to lie down, as she was
up all night. And she can&#8217;t do anything
now but wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy poor father locked up in the police
station!&#8221; said Jem, looking inclined to shed
tears, which evidence of feeling was set down
to his credit by Madge, but had quite the
contrary effect on Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Jem,&#8221; said he sharply, &#8220;don&#8217;t
go and make things worse by behaving like
a girl. Set to and find some work, so that
mother hasn&#8217;t the worry of knowing you&#8217;re
doing nothing as well as her other troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8220;If you think I&#8217;m going to stir out of the
house before I see father safe back again,
you&#8217;re very much mistaken. I care more
about him than I do about a shilling or two&mdash;so
there,&#8221; Jem returned with a mixture of
sulkiness and obstinacy.</p>

<p>Bob shrugged his shoulders, and addressed
Madge without taking any more notice of his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I had better go to the office as
usual, and do the best I can without father,
in case he&#8217;s wanted,&#8221; he said. And he too
hurried away.</p>

<p>Then the little girls came down, and had
to be sent off to school without being told
anything, except that father was out, in accordance
with Mrs. Kayll&#8217;s wishes, after which
there was no one at home but Madge, Jem,
the baby, and their mother.</p>

<p>There was so much to do during the morning
that the elder sister had no time to be
miserable, and somehow Bob&#8217;s view of the
matter had made her feel much lighter
hearted. It was a mistake which would be
set right very shortly, and father would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
home in the course of the day, and laugh
with them over his amusing adventure. She
found herself singing over her work later on,
after her mother had gone out to be present
at the hearing of the case, and would not
even be depressed by Jem&#8217;s solemn eyes
which followed her about full of surprise and
reproach.</p>

<p>But her singing did not last long, for baby
was extremely fretful, and would not sit on
the floor and watch her as usual. He whimpered
and fidgeted, and was not in the least
amused by Jem&#8217;s attempts at playing with
him. In short he was so tiresome, for a
good-tempered baby, that Madge felt sure he
could not be well, and carried him about with
her on her left arm, while she dusted the
rooms, and made the beds as well as she could
with her right hand alone, feeling not a little
anxious all the time on the little brother&#8217;s
account. Suppose he should have &#8220;caught
something,&#8221; how dreadful it would be!</p>

<small>SELF-REPROACH.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">JACK reached home again a little before
six, and, just because he was in a fever
of anxiety to know whether Mr. Kayll was
at home again, kept strong guard over himself,
and walked in as coolly as usual, for he
found the front door open.</p>

<p>His eyes glanced quickly round the little
parlour as he entered. His father was not
there, and, moreover, there was such a cloud
of gloom upon everyone that the courage he
had been keeping up all day suddenly left
him, and his heart sank with a leaden weight.
What did this mean? What new misfortune
had happened?</p>

<p>Tea was spread, for in trouble or joy children
at least must eat. Besides, Madge had
found relief from mental excitement in going
about her usual duties, poor girl. She was
now walking to and fro, with the baby lying
quietly in her arms, its little face looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
very hot and flushed. The child certainly
had all the appearance of sickening for some
complaint.</p>

<p>Edie and Bessie were just taking their
places at the table, hungry enough to be able
to look calmly on any prospect but that of
being deprived of food. There was plenty
of bread and dripping at all events, and they
had had but little dinner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll was occupied in trying to console
Jem, who would look on the worst side
of everything, and was very unhappy in consequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the news?&#8221; asked Jack in a low
voice of Madge. &#8220;What about father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s remanded for a week,&#8221; said Madge,
stopping before him and rocking herself from
one foot to the other. &#8220;That means that we
shall have to get on without him as well as
we can for all that time, though I don&#8217;t know
how we shall manage to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t anything be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems not. And mother says she
<i>must</i> get a lawyer to defend him, even if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
have to live on bread and water; or else
there&#8217;s no saying what might happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack gazed at her silently for a minute.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has mother got any money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not much. Father gave a lot
to those Colesons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m. I think we boys ought to be able
to earn enough to live on somehow. I can
do with very little myself. What&#8217;s the
matter with baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He doesn&#8217;t seem at all
right, poor darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both looked round, for Mrs. Kayll
had come to the table, and was cutting bread,
and talking to the little girls meanwhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must try and not make ourselves
unhappy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are so many
worse troubles than this. All we have to do
is to be patient, and to be as careful as possible
over every halfpenny. You three must
stay away from school for the present, and
Jem must contrive to get something to do,
and with one thing and another I daresay
we shall get on pretty well.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;But how was it?&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;How
could they mistake father for a burglar if he
told them his name, and his business, and
where he came from, and everything? It&#8217;s
so absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not altogether so absurd as you think,&#8221;
his mother answered. &#8220;There he was passing
the shop that was robbed at a time of
night when very few people are out; and
though he said he hadn&#8217;t a penny about him,
when he was searched there were two pounds
in his purse. It is very odd, certainly, for
though your father took five sovereigns with
him, he lent them all to Mrs. Coleson, and he
couldn&#8217;t account for how he came by those
other two in the least. No more can I. If
it hadn&#8217;t been for them, I believe he would
have been here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack listened to this with a rapidly paling
face. What he had meant for a pleasant
surprise had turned out a most unpleasant
one after all; his little joke had very likely
done all the mischief. He had been denying
himself, scraping and saving for months,
working extra hours when by that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
earn a few more pence, and all for this!
All to send his own father to prison for a
week, and to cause a great deal more than
what he had saved to be spent on proving
him not guilty of theft. As these thoughts
came clearly before him, he stole unnoticed
from the room, and went upstairs to sit
down in a chair by his own bed and cry as
he had hardly cried since he was a baby.</p>

<p>Down-stairs his absence was soon noticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jack? He must want his tea,&#8221;
said Mrs. Kayll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he went upstairs,&#8221; said Madge
sighing. &#8220;He scarcely stopped to hear about
father. He takes things very calmly, does
Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie coloured at Madge&#8217;s tone, and became
her favourite brother&#8217;s champion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack is too sensible to make a fuss when
it won&#8217;t do any good. He&#8217;s as sorry as anybody
else, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go and tell him to come to tea,
Bessie,&#8221; said her mother.</p>

<p>The little girl went at once, and found
poor Jack with his face in his hands sobbing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
She was quite awe-struck, never remembering
to have seen him shed a single tear&mdash;her
brave manly brother, fourteen years old, who
if he hurt himself only whistled, if he were
scolded took it in silence, if he were ill kept
the fact to himself until somebody found it
out. Her Jack&mdash;crying!</p>

<p>She was half inclined to creep away again,
feeling as though she had no business to have
found him out, as he had come away here
alone. But altering her mind she went and
wound her arms round his neck, kissed him,
called him her &#8220;dear old Jack,&#8221; dried his
eyes with her own pocket-handkerchief, and
cried too.</p>

<p>Jack sobbed on for a few minutes, then
suddenly sprang to his feet, dashed his sleeve
across his eyes, and tossed back his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s the good?
Don&#8217;t tell them, Bessie. I&#8217;m worse than a
girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they all say you don&#8217;t care!&#8221; murmured
his sister half to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them!&#8221; Jack returned proudly, pouring
out some cold water and washing his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
vigorously till the marks of tears disappeared,
and the redness was not only in his eyelids
but everywhere else as well. &#8220;Does it show?
Will they suspect me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no fear of that. If you went
down with the tears standing on your cheeks
they&#8217;d only think you&#8217;d been laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack seemed relieved by this view of the
case, and stood for a few seconds thinking,
whereupon all his composure vanished, his
lip quivered, and a fresh rush of tears came
to his eyes. He turned quickly away, fighting
to keep them back, while Bessie took his
hand and held it, puzzled and half frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it all about father?&#8221; she asked timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all,&#8221; began the boy, choking back a
sob, &#8220;because I was such a great stupid
idiot! Don&#8217;t tell the others, but those two
pounds were mine. I worked so hard, and
saved them&mdash;to please father when he was
hard up, and then instead of just giving
them to him and saying so, I must put them
in his purse for a joke, and make no end of
mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind, Jack. It can&#8217;t be helped.
And they can tell the magistrate so, you
know, and then it will be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a week!&#8221; groaned Jack, washing
his face again. &#8220;There! That&#8217;s over!&#8221; he
added, drying it vigorously. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
see me make such a goose of myself again in
a hurry. Bessie, if you tell anyone I&#8217;ve been
crying I&#8217;ll never forgive you.&#8221;</p>

<small>AN INVALID.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;TROUBLES never come singly,&#8221; said
poor Mrs. Kayll as she took her
youngest child from Madge&#8217;s arms, and looked
uneasily at its flushed face. &#8220;If he keeps
like this, we must send for the doctor. I
can&#8217;t understand it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time was about half-past six in the
morning, and Madge had been holding the
child while her mother dressed. Both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
mother and daughter had had their rest
broken by the baby&#8217;s fretfulness, as he woke
up and cried at intervals the whole night
through, and first one, then the other, had
risen to walk about with him, trying to
soothe him to sleep.</p>

<p>It was with a sinking heart that Madge
lighted the fire and set the kettle on to boil
before breakfast. Was everything going
wrong all at once? But she put on as cheerful
an expression as she could, and nobody
expected her to be merry, as it was not in
her nature.</p>

<p>Everything felt uncomfortable this morning.
The girls were to stay away from
school, as their mother did not want to spare
the money for them, and with Jem there as
well the house seemed too full. Besides, both
girls were so anxious to be of use that Madge,
in hurrying to and fro, tumbled over them in
all directions. They dusted the rooms, they
made the beds, they came constantly to
Madge with the question, &#8220;What shall we
do next?&#8221; till she was nearly distracted.
Yet she racked her brains every time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
something for them to do, knowing that they
would be still more trouble if they were idle.
One idle person was bad enough!</p>

<p>&#8220;Jem,&#8221; said she, as she washed up the
breakfast things, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you going to see
after some work?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jem, who was sitting on the table swinging
his legs to and fro, and looking very dismal,
nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, you know, if you could earn
ever so little, it would be a help; I suppose
Mr. Graves would give you a character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madgie,&#8221; said the boy; &#8220;I&#8217;m going
soon, but I must wait until baby&#8217;s better. I
can&#8217;t go away while he&#8217;s so ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t do him any good by staying
at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, but I shouldn&#8217;t feel satisfied
to be away until I know what&#8217;s the matter
with him. Besides, I <i>might</i> be wanted, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge compressed her lips, feeling more
inclined to be angry at what seemed only
selfishness, than to admire him, as she usually
did, for his affectionate disposition.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Bob and Jack are gone,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were obliged. And I don&#8217;t think
they mind so much,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>The day passed very slowly, and everyone
seemed to find it too long. Mrs. Kayll
came down, and attended to various duties
with the baby always in her arms, as she did
not care to part with him, even to Madge.</p>

<p>&#8220;He keeps just the same,&#8221; she said in the
afternoon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he looks any
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge caressed the little one&#8217;s cheek. She
felt half inclined to cry when she saw the
small face quiver as if with pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t understand it, poor little fellow,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I think he wonders why we
don&#8217;t help him, and make him feel well again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing father doesn&#8217;t know,&#8221;
said Jem, who was looking on. &#8220;How anxious
he would be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Kayll was turning over a
question in her own mind. Should she send
for the doctor, or should she wait a little
longer? She could not afford to pay him, as
it had taken more than she knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
spare to pay for someone to defend her husband&mdash;a
matter that she had arranged on the
previous day. The lawyer who had taken
the case in hand had told her she need be
under no anxiety, as all was sure to go well.
There would be no difficulty in proving that
Mr. Kayll had been arrested in mistake, with
the evidence of Mrs. Coleson to show where
he had been, and that of Jack to explain his
possession of the money, while plenty of
people could answer for his being a respectable
auctioneer, and the last man in the world
to be mixed up in a burglary, so that Mrs.
Kayll was as much at ease in her mind on
that score as she could be while her husband
was still detained.</p>

<p>The evening found no change in the baby.
He sat up for a few minutes once or twice,
amused by something Bessie brought to attract
his attention, but his heavy head soon
sank back on his mother&#8217;s breast, and he
would seldom rouse himself and look round.</p>

<p>Bob came in at his usual time, ate his supper,
and then went to Mrs. Kayll with an air
of determination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>&#8220;We can&#8217;t let you knock yourself up, old
lady,&#8221; he said, firmly but gently taking the
sick child from her. &#8220;You are making yourself
ill. Now, sit in the arm-chair and rest&mdash;and
Madge, get a pillow to make her more
comfortable.&#8221; And Mrs. Kayll yielded, though
she had refused again and again to let Madge
relieve her, and dozed off to sleep, while the big,
rough boy walked patiently to and fro, to and
fro, with his tiny brother cradled in his arms.</p>

<p>The baby seemed fairly comfortable in its
new position, and was quiet as long as the
regular movement went on. Madge kept the
others quiet, and soon sent them to bed, for
the poor exhausted mother was now in a
sound slumber, and they all felt it a duty not
to disturb her rest.</p>

<p>Bob walked on with untiring patience, as
one hour crept after another and vanished
for ever, refusing Madge&#8217;s offers to &#8220;take
baby,&#8221; and trying in a whisper to get her,
too, to go to bed. Once or twice he sat down
until the child began to be restless, when he
went on with his steady pacing as regularly
as a machine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>It was nearly three when Mrs. Kayll started
up, cramped from sleeping in a chair, and
looked in a horrified way at the clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor children!&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you wake me? Poor boy! how
tired you look!&#8221; And she kissed Bob&#8217;s forehead
as she relieved him of his burden.
&#8220;Come, Madge, we will go upstairs, and get
what sleep we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge followed her, with a new idea making
its way into her slow brain. For the first
time she was beginning to see what virtues
that we never suspect may be hidden under
a rough and uncouth appearance, virtues that
only come out when there is trouble or care
to call them forth.</p>

<p>The next morning was much like this one
over again, until breakfast was finished, and
the two boys gone. Jem was still lounging
about in idleness, when there came a call from
above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send Jem for the doctor&mdash;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy did not wait to be sent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
snatched up his cap and darted off. His
sister ran upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, mother? Is he worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>The baby was still lying quietly on Mrs.
Kayll&#8217;s lap&mdash;not flushed now, but extremely
pale. Madge drew near and spoke to him;
but though he opened his eyes he did not
seem to see her, but gazed out with a curious
blank stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; cried Madge, clasping her
hands, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he knows me. Baby,
it&#8217;s Madge. Baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll&#8217;s forehead wrinkled itself into
upright lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very strange,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;I
am getting rather frightened, though I thought
at first this morning that he was better.&mdash;No,
go away, dears,&#8221; for Edie and Bessie were
peering in at the door. &#8220;I am going to keep
him very quiet for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t we come and kiss him, mother?&#8221;
asked Bessie imploringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Not till the doctor has seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girls went unwillingly back to
their work, and Madge knelt on the floor by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
her mother, still trying to attract the little
one&#8217;s notice, but in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s some illness&mdash;something
catching?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell, dear. It doesn&#8217;t look like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent, listening anxiously for
Jem&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Madge, he won&#8217;t eat, and he
can&#8217;t go on like that. He has hardly swallowed
any food since the day before yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before long Jem came flying back, scarlet
with running, panting, and out of breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor will come as soon as he can,&#8221; he
told them&mdash;&#8220;most likely in an hour or so.
Can I do anything, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she answered, scarcely taking
her eyes from the pallid little face. &#8220;Nothing
but keep quiet, and get the others to be quiet
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very still the house was for the two hours
before the arrival of the doctor, for whom all
were so anxiously looking. And all the while
the baby lay in that listless state, recognizing
nobody. The children spoke in hushed voices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and whispered to each other that they wondered
what father would say if he knew, and
that they did wish he were at home. For
the household pet had scarcely had a day&#8217;s
illness, and had seldom been even what the
nurses call &#8220;fractious.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last. The doctor had come. He was a
thin clever-looking young man, who seemed
as though he had known all of them since
they were born, and who touched Bessie&#8217;s
soft hair as he passed her on the staircase,
and clapped Jem on the shoulder when he
let him in.</p>

<p>He was a long time shut in the bed-room
with Mrs. Kayll and the baby. The children,
waiting about outside, could hear his voice,
as he asked a number of questions, followed
by their mother&#8217;s low-voiced answers. Then,
all at once, he came out, and found their four
eager faces waiting for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing catching,&#8221; he said smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to send him some physic, and he&#8217;ll be
ever so much better to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<small>NIGHT.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HE seemed to think baby had got at
something poisonous, and sucked it&mdash;paint
or dye of some kind,&#8221; said Mrs. Kayll
afterwards to Madge. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to say
he hasn&#8217;t, when he puts everything he comes
near into his mouth. One can&#8217;t always have
one&#8217;s eye upon him. What do you think,
dear? Does he look any worse&mdash;or a trifle
better? I don&#8217;t know myself, I&#8217;ve been looking
at him so long, but I almost fancy there
is a little improvement.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was again towards evening, and, so
slowly does time seem to go when anything
occurs out of the common course of events,
the children began to feel as though their
father had been absent for years instead of
only three days. Madge herself felt almost
as though she had grown older in that short
time. There were actually lines in her
smooth brow as she examined the baby, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the difference she could not see. She kissed
the small white hand that lay so listlessly
over her mother&#8217;s dress, and the thick drops
clouded her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, baby, baby!&#8221; she sighed, with a chill
of dread creeping over her, as she found that
he still seemed neither to see nor hear.
&#8220;Mother, I wish it were any one of us but
him, for we could at least tell how we felt.
I wish with all my heart it was me.&#8221;</p>

<p>One by one the children went to say good-night&mdash;each
more tired by doing nothing in
particular than by the usual lessons or work.
Each kissed the baby&#8217;s white cheek, and stole
softly away to bed, scarcely speaking; and
again Mrs. Kayll and Madge were left to
watch and sleep in turn through the night
hours.</p>

<p>There were only three bed-rooms in this
little house where the Kaylls lived, for, when
people are as poor as they were, they have
often to crowd into a small space. In fact,
they would not have been able to afford a
house to themselves in the outskirts of
London, but that they had this one very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cheaply from its many disadvantages. For
one thing, it was so old that it was not considered
very safe, while the one adjoining it
was really so unsafe that it had not been
inhabited for some time. Then it stood so
much below the road that it was damp, and
the wall-paper used to peel off in places on
the ground floor.</p>

<p>Of the three bed-rooms one belonged to
the boys, one to the girls, and the other to
Mr. and Mrs. Kayll and the baby.</p>

<p>The boys had gone early to bed that night,
Bob and Jack so thoroughly tired out that
they quickly fell asleep, the latter to dream
that his father came home and caned him
well&mdash;although Mr. Kayll had never caned
anyone in his life, and probably never would&mdash;for
his foolish little joke which had done
so much harm. For, though no one had said
a word of reproach to him on the subject since
his part in the affair became known, Jack
blamed himself bitterly, and was at the
bottom of his heart extremely unhappy, but
at the same time much too proud to confess
the fact, or even to let it be guessed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his manner or appearance. Only Bessie
seemed to understand, and was very loving
to him in consequence in her shy little way.</p>

<p>Yet, as a matter of fact, though he had
helped to bring about this trouble that had
fallen on the whole family, Jack was not
more unhappy than Jem, who lay long awake,
restless and dissatisfied with himself, wishing
that he had not thrown away his situation
for a mere whim; that he had tried for another;
that his father were back; that the
baby were not ill; that they were all better
off; wishing and wishing, until his wishes
gradually faded into uneasy dreams, and his
dreams into a complete blank.</p>

<p>In the girls&#8217; room there was one more
wakeful still&mdash;little Bessie, whose mind was
very active, as is often the case with delicate
people. She lay wide awake, hour after hour,
her small brain busy with one thing after
another, until she felt too nervous to lie still,
stepped out of bed, and began to dress.</p>

<p>For Bessie had taken it into her head that
she was being deceived for her good, and that
her little brother was really dying.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;They say he will be better in the morning,
and they mean that all his illness will be
over, and that he will be a little angel,&#8221; she
said to herself. &#8220;And father will never see
him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the tears crept quietly down her
cheeks as she put on her clothes. If she
could not sleep it would be better to be up,
and then she should hear what was going on.
She loved her baby brother so dearly, and
perhaps he would never again smile at her,
never again prattle to her in his pretty unintelligible
way, which she always fancied she
understood&mdash;she hardly thought anyone
understood or loved him as she did. Well,
there was one way.</p>

<p>She kneeled down by her bed, folded her
hands, and closed her eyes, while her lips
moved softly for some time, though she only
said the same simple words again and again.</p>

<p>At last she stood up, dried her eyes, and
went to the window to look wistfully up at
the stars. Poor little Bessie! she loved every
one she knew so much that her only great
wish was that she and her father, mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
brothers and sisters might all die at once, and
so no one be left lonely upon earth.</p>

<p>A sound from down-stairs made her start
and go to the door to listen. Somebody was
certainly up and moving about. Who could
it be? She peered out and saw that her
mother&#8217;s door was shut, while a streak of
light beneath told that a candle was left
burning. At the same time from the room
occupied by the boys came to her ears something
very like a snore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it? It can&#8217;t be a thief, because
he would know that we are too poor to have
anything worth stealing. And yet&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet it must be a thief. Else, why
was he creeping about so quietly? Her
heart began to beat terribly fast, and she
shivered with fear. She stepped across the
passage and listened at the door with the
chink of light under it. If mother and
Madge were awake she would speak to them,
but she dared not tap unless she heard their
voices, for fear of disturbing the baby. Had
the wood that divided her from them only
been transparent she would have seen her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mother in an arm-chair half dozing, but still
awake enough to notice if there were any
uneasy movement on the part of the little
invalid that lay in her arms, and Madge, still
dressed, lying across the bed, just as she had
carelessly thrown herself, in a sound sleep.</p>

<p>How still all was within! So still that
Bessie forgot the noise down-stairs, in the
fear that this silence must mean something
wrong. Perhaps the little brother was already
gone from among them when she was
kneeling by her bed asking that he might be
allowed to stay here and grow up to be a
man. The tears rose in her eyes and sobs in
her throat.</p>

<p>All at once a cold chill stole over her. The
cautious step was coming upstairs, slowly
and very softly. It was a man certainly, but
what he wanted she could not guess. Many
dreadful stories that she had heard came into
her mind, and she dared not cry out or shriek
for fear he might strike her down. Each step
creaked under his weight, and all was so still
that she could even hear his heavy breathing
as she pressed herself against the wall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the hope that he would pass her in the
dark.</p>

<p>He was advancing towards her now, and
before she could summon up courage to move
his hand had touched her, and he had stifled
an exclamation of surprise. Bessie trembled
so that she was sinking to the floor from
fright, but the hand that had touched her
grasped her by the arm and held her up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo! Who&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl could hardly keep back a
scream of joy and relief as she heard these
muttered words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob!&#8221; she said in a sobbing whisper,
&#8220;how you frightened me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? What&#8217;s the matter? What are
you doing here? What are you shivering
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to listen if&mdash;if everything was all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; said Bob, holding her tightly
in his arms, for she still seemed hardly able
to stand. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve been down-stairs, where
I could walk about without disturbing the
others, as I woke and couldn&#8217;t sleep again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Poor little mouse! You have been working
yourself up into a fidget. There, go back to
bed, you little goosie. Walking about in the
middle of the night like a little ghost!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll&#8217;s door opened, and Madge
looked out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anything wrong?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Bob answered quickly. &#8220;How&#8217;s
baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleeping nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you hear that, Bess. Now, toddle
into bed again, and be quick and do the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her a squeeze and let her go, and
Bessie, comforted by the news and the caress,
obeyed his orders, not only as to getting into
bed, but as to going off at once into a sound
and dreamless sleep.</p>

<small>A STORM.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;NOW I hope we shall have no more
troubles before father comes home,&#8221;
said Madge on the Saturday afternoon, as she
helped her mother to iron some pinafores and
pocket-handkerchiefs she had been washing
out. &#8220;Baby&#8217;s getting better, and only wants
plenty of strengthening food; and Jem begins
work again on Monday&mdash;only three shillings
a week, though, to begin with&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll
soon be tired of that; and&mdash;why do you look
so serious, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have so much to make me look so,
Madge. You talk of no further troubles, and
forget that to-morrow&#8217;s Sunday, and there&#8217;s
nothing for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge looked horrified, and scorched a
handkerchief through stopping to gaze at her
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come to an end of your money?&#8221;
she asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;Very nearly. I must keep enough to get
what&#8217;s necessary for baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother! I ought to try and earn
something too, though I shouldn&#8217;t like to
leave you to do all the work at home. Well,
never mind about meat for to-morrow. We&#8217;ll
just have bread, that&#8217;s the cheapest thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Jack, coming in, for
he was free early on Saturday. &#8220;Nothing
but bread for dinner? Here&#8217;s enough for a
mutton chop or two at any rate.&#8221; And he
placed some shillings on the ironing-cloth before
Mrs. Kayll.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;<i>five!</i> What
have you done for your own dinners during
the week?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was nearly through the doorway by
this time, but he looked back over his shoulder
half laughing, half confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone without any,&#8221; he said, and ran off.</p>

<p>The tears came for an instant into Mrs.
Kayll&#8217;s tired eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy,&#8221; said she softly. &#8220;How good
he is! And we have always thought he cared
for nobody but himself!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;He is so quiet and says so little,&#8221; Madge
answered, &#8220;that it is hard to understand
him. But he is of more real use than any
of the others. This morning and yesterday
he was up before me, and had lighted the
fire, put the kettle on, drawn up the blinds,
and unfastened the doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll thoughtfully put the money
into her purse. She was surprised to find
how little she had known of what was in her
own children. Where had they learned so
much unselfishness? she asked herself, not
suspecting that they learned it of her, who
never considered her own feelings or her own
pleasure, but lived for them and her husband.</p>

<p>Not long after, Bob came in with another
contribution to the family exchequer, in the
shape of six more shillings which he had by
some means contrived to earn while taking
care of his father&#8217;s office; so that now Mrs.
Kayll began to think they must have reached
the lowest depth of their troubles, and that
things were beginning to mend.</p>

<p>But she was wrong. The worst catastrophe
of all was in store when they least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
expected it, but just now came the calm before
the storm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll went out that evening and
bought some meat for the Sunday dinner,
and the essence of beef the doctor had ordered
for the baby, making what she spent go as
far as possible, but yet providing enough for
all, making up by an extra quantity of potatoes
for the rather short supply of mutton.
As for pudding, that was a luxury out of
fashion in the Kayll family, except on Sundays,
for a long time.</p>

<p>They all went to bed that night in tolerably
good spirits, dismissing cares and anxieties
until the next week, and, instead of
sighing too much for the absent one, looking
forward to the time of his return, and rejoicing
that one more day of his detention was
gone.</p>

<p>The next was a soft sultry hazy morning,
with thundery-looking clouds lying at first
low round the horizon, then here and there
slowly rising up in dark threatening masses.
The air was heavy and oppressive, and the
blacks lay about thickly, or lazily floated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
down from above. In spite of the unsettled
look of the weather, the two little girls and
Jack went to church, leaving Madge preparing
the potatoes, Mrs. Kayll attending to
various domestic duties with the baby on
her arm, Bob cleaning knives and forks, and
Jem looking on at first one, then another,
with his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a nice easy time of it with the
cooking since father went,&#8221; said Madge,
scraping out the black eye of a potato. They
had dropped into a way of speaking of Mr.
Kayll as though he were on a visit, and
were expected home at the latest on Tuesday.
Mrs. Kayll, however, could not quite, as the
children did, make the best of to-day, and
leave to-morrow to take care of itself. It
was not easy to forget that the milkman had
refused to bring any more milk until his bill
was paid, or that the butcher and baker
would not let her have either bread or meat,
unless she paid for them on the spot. Of
course they had their own families to think
about, and it was but natural that they should
consider them first. But the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
next week and its struggles, and the difficulty
of feeding all the hungry mouths, made
her look this morning very care-worn and
old.</p>

<p>And even when her husband should come
home, it might be some time before he was
able to supply her with money, for lately he
had had but little to do.</p>

<p>The potatoes were cooking; the mutton
was beginning to sputter in the oven, and to
smell very good, when the storm that had
been threatening all the morning came on
with violence. The claps of thunder grew
nearer and louder, the lightning flashed in at
all the windows, and after each flash Jem
counted&mdash;&#8220;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&#8221;&mdash;to see how
many miles away the storm actually was.
But soon the thunder followed so quickly
that there was no time to count at all&mdash;it
was evidently just overhead.</p>

<p>Then the rain came down in torrents, and
Mrs. Kayll looked anxiously out, and hoped
those poor children were in shelter, for the
church-goers had not yet come home, although
it was past the usual time for their return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Madge looked in the oven to see that the
meat was not cooking too fast, and then she
and the boys ran upstairs to look from a
bed-room window, and watch how the fierce
rain pelted down on the dry road and beat
up again in spray. They could not see this
from the lower windows, as theirs being such
an old house, and the road having been
much raised since it was built, it stood quite
in a hole, and there were four steps to go
down from the gate to the door. The dwellings
on each side were also lower than the
roadway, but the Kaylls&#8217; was the lowest of
all.</p>

<p>How it rained! Faster and faster! Jem
fancied this was how the heavy drops must
have poured from the skies when the great
flood was, and nearly all the world was
drowned. He watched the little rivulets
that ran down the hill at the foot of which
they lived, noticed the stream by the side of
the path growing wider and wider, and saw
that the gratings above the drains were getting
choked up with rubbish, so that, from
letting the water run through too slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they came to not letting it run through at
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those children!&#8221; sighed Mrs. Kayll,
looking anxiously up the hill. &#8220;I am afraid
they will be soaked to the skin. Not in
sight yet! Where can they be?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she went down-stairs with Madge,
leaving baby in Bob&#8217;s charge. Bob held him
up where he too could see what was going
on outside&mdash;the heavy rain still falling, the
water beginning to stand in the road, in a
pool that spread and spread&mdash;the passers-by,
hastening home under dripping umbrellas,
those who wanted to cross the road having
to go far enough round, or else plucking up
sufficient courage to wade through, ankle-deep,
as though satisfied that they were already
so wet that a little more or less could
not make much difference.</p>

<p>Still heavily as before the rain fell, and
the little streams flowed ever faster down
the street. Jem was still thinking of the
flood and staring out, when Mrs. Kayll&#8217;s
voice called from below:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob, come and help me here a minute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
It&#8217;s beginning to come in at the front
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob ran down, but no help of his could
stop the water out, for it was now fast pouring
over from the pavement down the four
steps and into the little area. Madge looked
on, as it trickled and spread along the passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the same at the back,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that we can do anything but
take some of the things upstairs if it keeps
on. I wish it would leave off raining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father always said we should be
flooded one of these days, standing in a hole
as we do,&#8221; said her mother disconsolately.</p>

<p>But instead of leaving off, it went on
harder than ever, the water rushing down
the hill and pouring into the house with
such force that Mrs. Kayll, who had taken
the baby from Bob, losing her nerve, opened
the front door and dashed up the steps to
the level of the road, calling to the children
to follow. Bob and Madge ran after, to find
that even on the pavement they were standing
in an inch or two of water, while the
rain beat on them fiercely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8220;Look, mother!&#8221; cried Bob excitedly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s rising fast, it&#8217;s a foot deep at the very
least in our parlour. And oh! what a shame!
Our nice dinner will be spoiled!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one comfort,&#8221; said Madge, who
looked pale and frightened, &#8220;the carpet&#8217;s so
bad already that being soaked can&#8217;t make it
any worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll did not answer. She was quite
overcome by this new misfortune, and scarcely
seemed to know what to do. Half mechanically
she moved higher up the hill, trying by
turning up her dress-skirt over him to shield
the baby from the wet, lest, weak as he was
after his illness, he should take a bad cold
and be worse again. Someone, seeing this,
put a big umbrella into her hand, from under
which she looked back to see her little home
getting every second more and more deeply
immersed.</p>

<p>Her more fortunate neighbours, whose
houses stood high and dry, came running
out of their doors and begged her to go in
with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, mother. You and Madgie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
take baby in out of the wet,&#8221; said Bob
eagerly. &#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt me, and I can let
you know as soon as it&#8217;s any good for you to
come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll hesitated, but the baby was
frightened, and as another flash of lightning
was followed by a deafening peal of thunder
the little thing began to cry. This plaintive
sound brought her more to herself. Whatever
happened to the house and its contents,
baby must be taken care of, and not allowed
to catch cold. And with that thought, she
yielded to the entreaties of a woman she
knew, who had taken her by the arm and
was gently trying to draw her in, and merely
saying, &#8220;Come, Madge,&#8221; disappeared from
the sight of the curious eyes that were watching
her from the windows on the opposite
side of the way.</p>

<p>Madge went too, glad enough to get into
shelter away from the beating rain and the
flashes of lightning, of which she was somewhat
afraid.</p>

<p>And all the while, in their bewilderment
and distress, both mother and daughter had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
entirely forgotten that Jem was with them
in the house when the water began to come
in, and that they had not seen him since.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>DESERTED.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Bob, carrying the baby, ran down
in answer to his mother&#8217;s call, Jem
remained where he was, looking out at the
storm. In spite of the natural feeling of
nervousness, he enjoyed seeing the lightning
flash out from the thick bank of heavy clouds,
showing their shapes where all had seemed
one mass of dull gray, and dart in a brilliant
jagged streak across the sky. For a little
time he forgot everything else in this strange
pleasure. In his mind was the thought that
it was like seeing fireworks, only that no
fireworks were half so grand.</p>

<p>Flash after flash. Peal after peal. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
had not been such a thunder-storm here for
years. Jem forgot even to look at the pool
stretching across the road; but when at last
he did bring his eyes down again to the
earth, it was to see that the sheet of water,
starred all over with the plashing rain-drops,
extended now in places actually over the
pavement. A cab came along, and the boy
laughed till the tears came into his eyes at
the concern of the old lady inside, who kept
putting out her head and telling the cabman
to go another way, while he insisted on
driving straight forwards, splashing up the
very centre of the road, without paying the
slightest heed to the old lady&#8217;s anger.</p>

<p>Jem watched until the cab and its occupant
were safe on dry land, or rather on land as
dry as any could be in such a rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what it&#8217;s like at the back,&#8221; he
said then. And when the flashes grew less
frequent, and seemed to come more from
behind the house, he ran into the bed-room
that looked on the yard where Mrs. Kayll
and Madge were wont to hang out the clothes
to dry every week, and on numbers of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
back windows and other yards, where other
people also hung out their clothes to dry.</p>

<p>The ground here was pretty nearly covered
with standing water, but there was at present
nothing much to be seen, except that in the
next yard but one several little jets of water
forced their way here and there through the
fence and spurted fiercely into the inclosure.
Beyond this last fence was a large space of
open ground not yet built upon and sloping
gently upwards, so that the rain ran down
the incline until checked by the wooden
palings. There it rose and rose, and the
jets grew larger as the water wore for itself
a passage, but the weight beyond was too
great to be kept back long by such a feeble
barricade. It gave way suddenly with a
report like that of a pistol, and the boards
were flung here and there as the flood dashed
onwards, sweeping away in its course the
next fence, and then those on each side of
the Kaylls&#8217; yard, while at the same time Jem
felt the floor shake under his feet.</p>

<p>At this he shrank back from the window
in horror, for there in an instant was water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
all round him, and nothing left standing of
the divisions between the yards but a post
here and there, like the last relics of a
wrecked vessel.</p>

<p>Running out into the passage with a vague
intention of getting away at once into safety,
Jem was about to descend the stairs, when
he found to his consternation that the lowest
steps were out of sight in muddy water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! Bob! Madge! Where are
you?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>He called again and again, but still there
was no reply save a kind of washing sound
from below, and a long muttering growl from
above. Where could they be? Had this
rush of water come upon them suddenly, and
were they drowned down there in the kitchen
or little parlour?</p>

<p>His first impulse was to go and look,
though his heart beat terribly fast, and all
his strength seemed to have gone and left
him weak and trembling. He descended a
few steps as far as the edge of the water, and
then all at once the sight of it made him sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and giddy, and he would have fallen in if he
had not turned round quickly, and, holding
by the balustrade, climbed up again to the
bed-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t have gone and left me,&#8221; he
sobbed. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t do that, without
even calling to me to come. And here I
am, and can&#8217;t get out! I shall have to stop
and be drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried once more to the front window,
and looked out first in one direction, then in
the other. Why, there they were&mdash;his mother
under an umbrella with the baby, Madge
and Bob in the road, higher up the hill, with
the rain beating upon them, and a few people
standing about talking to them earnestly.
He tried to open the window and shout to
them, but the sash stuck in its frame, and
before he had succeeded in making it slide
up, Mrs. Kayll had carried the baby into a
house, near which she had been standing, and
Madge had followed. Bob was left alone,
looking about him as though trying to find
a dry way to get back.</p>

<p>Jem shouted his name, but a clap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thunder at that moment made his voice inaudible;
he saw his brother turn to speak to
some one, and then walk across to the other
side of the road.</p>

<p>They had left him to his fate, then! He
was deserted. The wild thought crossed his
mind that they had perhaps done it to punish
him for the faults that came back to his
memory now with perfect clearness. He
saw all in a moment that he had up till now
cared far more for himself than for anyone
else, and this was the result: those who ought
to have loved him had forgotten him in the
moment of danger, or, worse still, had wilfully
left him to do the best he could for
himself.</p>

<p>Poor Jem! This was a lesson he never
unlearnt. The misery and fear of the discovery
were so great that he was completely
overcome. He dropped down on the bed-room
floor unconscious. It was just at that
point of time that Bob, picking his way back
with water nearly up to his ankles, stopped
short with a sudden exclamation, and stared
about him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;where on earth is
Jem?&#8221;</p>

<p>The recollection that his brother had been
with them at first, and that he had seen
nothing of him since the water began to enter
the house, turned him quite cold with misgivings.
How could he have so entirely forgotten
the boy all this time?</p>

<p>Not that it was really surprising in the
sudden excitement and bustle of such an
unexpected disaster. And besides, the Kayll
boys were so accustomed to taking care of
themselves, that it was not natural to anyone
to trouble about them, or inquire where they
were when absent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll turn up,&#8221; was the family feeling
if a boy were missing. But now Bob was
aghast at the thought that Jem might <i>not</i>
turn up. He waded towards the house with
pale face and staring eyes. His brother must
be somewhere within, yet he was at neither
window;&mdash;where could he be?</p>

<p>The rain had ceased to fall at last, and the
depth of the flood was not increasing, even
though as yet there was no evidence of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
growing less. As people began fast to collect,
now that the worst was over, and to make
some attempts to clear away the rubbish that
was choking up the gratings over the drains,
so that the water might run through more
quickly, he asked of several if they had seen
Jem; but no one remembered anything of
him since the beginning of the storm. As
Bob explained his fear that the boy must be
still in the house, which it was now impossible
to enter except by the bed-room windows,
a ladder was quickly fetched and laid across
from the road to the sill of that which Jem,
on his discovery that he was left behind, had
thrown open.</p>

<p>Another minute, and Bob was in the little
bed-room, lifting up his brother, who still lay
in a dead faint on the floor. As he raised
him he heard the people shouting to him
from the outside to be quick, and without
knowing the meaning of their excited cries
he carried Jem with all speed to the window,
passed him out to a man who was half-way
up the ladder ready to receive him, slid down
closely after them, and was seized by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hands and dragged across to the other side
of the road, just as with a rumbling sound,
and then a terrible crash, the little old house
and the one adjoining it fell forward, a heap
of ruins.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>RETURNING KINDNESS.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON this stormy Sunday&mdash;while Mr. Kayll
in his solitude was wondering how it
fared with his wife and children, and never
dreaming that it was a happy thing for him
that he did not know; and while Jack and
his two little sisters were walking homewards
from church, after waiting in the porch of an
empty house until the rain was over, without
a suspicion of what was in store for them&mdash;three
people at least were happier than they
had been for years.</p>

<p>These were Mrs. Coleson and her children.
They were still in the same lodgings, but
their poverty was a thing of the past. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Coleson&#8217;s mother, the hard and cold woman
who had never helped them while she was
alive, had at her death, a few days ago, left
everything she possessed to her son&#8217;s widow
and her little grandchildren.</p>

<p>And now the rent was paid, and they were
all full of plans for the future. The youngest
child, who was already better, lay on the bed
with one hand in her mother&#8217;s, and a smile
lighting up her small pinched face, as Amy
drew a wonderful picture of the beautiful
life that was before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a dear little cottage in the
country,&#8221; she was saying, &#8220;with ivy and
roses growing all over it, and a garden, full
of fruit and flowers and vegetables, and
chickens&mdash;you must let us have chickens,
mother&mdash;and a cat and kittens, and a big
dog, and then we shall enjoy ourselves all
day long. Won&#8217;t it be lovely, baby? And
you&#8217;ll learn to walk, and grow up straight
and tall, and Kitty will get the roses back
into those white cheeks of hers, and mother
will get well and strong and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is sad, though,&#8221; said Mrs. Coleson, &#8220;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
think how many poor things we shall leave
behind us in London, whose grandmothers
have no money to leave them, and who will
live as we have been living until they
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were quiet for a little while;
but they soon began to plan how they would
have some little girls and boys they knew to
stay with them in that new home, and they
should enjoy themselves too.</p>

<p>Already Mrs. Coleson had some money to
use, and she could have as much more as she
liked, while she made her arrangements for
leaving Wingate Row. But her first duty
was to pay her debt to Mr. Kayll, whose visit
to her had, as she knew, resulted in a great
trouble falling upon his family.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon, Amy,&#8221; she said, interrupting
the children&#8217;s chatter, &#8220;I think, if
the rain and thunder are over, you and I
might leave Kitty and baby in Mrs. Smith&#8217;s
care while we go over to Denham Green.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy looked delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
mind being left, baby, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>The child only laughed, for their old landlady
was almost like another mother to them
all, and they were greatly attached to her.</p>

<p>And so it befell that the same day, towards
evening, Mrs. Coleson and Amy went over
to Buxton Street, but not to No. 15, for that
number had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>It was now their turn to aid, comfort, and
advise, although, indeed, there were plenty
of people willing to help the sufferers by the
accident as far as lay in their power. There
were doors open to them, meals for them to
share, offers of assistance in saving what
was left of their belongings from the wreck.
Poor Mrs. Kayll, however, sadly needed someone
to manage for her, for this last calamity
had been such a shock, that at first she seemed
quite helpless and broken down.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s of no use to make a fuss, though,&#8221;
said Jack, who insisted on looking on the
bright side of it all. &#8220;We all knew the house
would come down some day, and if it hadn&#8217;t
fallen now it would have been much too wet
to live in. And I don&#8217;t believe it was healthy
before. As for Jem, though he nearly got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
buried in the ruins, he didn&#8217;t quite, and he&#8217;s
all right now, and thinks Bob a hero, which
he never did before. Then, if father had
been here, he couldn&#8217;t have prevented the
flood, or the house falling, and there&#8217;d have
been another to find room for somewhere,
to-night. Things might have been ever so
much worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madge entered into this cheerful view of
the matter, and went with Mrs. Coleson to
find lodgings where they could all be taken
in at once. For though the neighbours were
kind enough, and one would have taken two
of the children, another two more, for the
night, they wanted to keep all together if it
could possibly be managed.</p>

<p>And so, before nightfall they were installed
in three empty rooms in a house in the next
street, and some people lent them one thing,
and some another&mdash;old boxes for table and
chairs, and the landlady of the lodging spared
what she could for them in the way of furniture,
until the boys and girls all declared it
was the best fun in the world, and that they
liked it better than being at home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>It was not till the next morning that the
water was sufficiently drained away for anything
to be done in the way of recovering
their property from the fallen building. All
hands went to work, though, as soon as it
was light, and the boys, instead of being cast
down at the sight of so many things broken,
bent, soaked or spoiled, shouted with laughter
as they recognized in a battered, shapeless,
flat object the metal tea-pot out of which they
had had tea ever since they could remember,
or found an extraordinary black pulpy mass
to be their mother&#8217;s old feather-bed.</p>

<p>Every bit of crockery was broken. The
clock would never go again. In fact, very
little that could be of any use except for firewood
was recovered. A blanket or two, so
transformed that at first nobody knew what
they were, later on a few bent and rusty
knives and forks, and a coal-scuttle, almost
made up the sum of available property when
all was done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kayll had really to start house-keeping
again from the very beginning, poorer
than when she and her husband began life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
together seventeen years ago, with only two
people to support instead of nine.</p>

<p>This morning Mrs. Coleson came back
laden with several little additions to their
comfort, insisting on staying there and helping
to the best of her power. For this day
or two her aid was very welcome, for Mrs.
Kayll and the elder children all felt that it
was impossible to decide upon anything, or
form any plan, until next Tuesday should be
over.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>REUNION.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE day had come: the eventful day when
Mr. Kayll&#8217;s case was to be heard again.
The children knew nothing whatever about
the law, but they had gathered from their
mother that Tuesday would decide their
father&#8217;s fate, and either set him free to come
back to them, or&mdash;or something too dreadful
even to be imagined would happen. But no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
one would allow this last thought a moment&#8217;s
entrance. He would come back, though there
was no home to come to, except in the sense
that any place is home where all those we
love are assembled.</p>

<p>It was all like a strange dream. Who
would have thought a week ago yesterday,
when Mr. Kayll went out, promising not to
be late, that he would never stand under that
roof again.</p>

<p>Yet Madge, philosophical as ever, felt that
it did not matter, that nothing really mattered
since they were all alive and well, so
long as father came back. They would all
work hard, and if they could earn enough to
live upon, surely they need not be unhappy.
The troubles of having to pinch, and save,
and wear shabby clothes that used once to
look too heavy to be borne, seemed so absurdly
light, now that she had faced the far
worse troubles of nearly losing first one, then
another of those she loved more than she
herself knew.</p>

<p>Madge had only the two little girls and
the baby to share her suspense, for Bob and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Jem knew that they could not do better than
go to their work; and Jack, who had a holiday,
as he was to appear as a witness, had
gone with his mother to the police-court.
She felt very lonely and nervous. It had
seemed so hard not to be able to go too.</p>

<p>The little girls had been for a long ramble,
and had succeeded in finding a few sickly
Londony wild-flowers, which they were putting
in a glass on the table to give a more
cheerful look to the bare unfurnished room.
Madge herself had done all she could to
brighten it, trying meanwhile not to think
regretfully of the little old parlour with its
shabby furniture and threadbare carpet full
of holes.</p>

<p>It was dull work waiting. There was so
much depending on the result of this &#8220;hearing.&#8221;
The question in the balance was,
whether an hour or two would see them a
reunited family, able through their love for
each other to bear all hardships while they
were together, or whether the same lapse of
time would leave them crushed and broken
by a blow greater than any they had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
felt&mdash;temporarily fatherless&mdash;disgraced&mdash;ruined,
with no idea how or where in future
they were to live.</p>

<p>It was little wonder that quiet stolid
Madge was pale and flurried, and could not
talk connectedly to her sisters, but answered
their remarks almost at random.</p>

<p>She busied herself for a while in setting
out the tea-things&mdash;a very mixed gathering
of cups, mugs, and saucers, that were certainly
not the most distant relations&mdash;then looked
anxiously from the window. Next she sent
Edie and Bessie up to wash their faces and
brush their untidy hair. Then she cut some
bread in readiness, looked at the baby critically,
decided that for such an occasion as this
he certainly ought to wear that clean pinafore
which she washed out and &#8220;got up&#8221; so
carefully this morning, carried him upstairs,
put it on, and smoothed the yellow down
that she called his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, if they would only come!&#8221; she
sighed, as she coaxed this yellow down to
stand up in a little crest from baby&#8217;s forehead
to his crown with a peculiar twist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
round of the brush which she stroked upwards
from the parting over his ears. &#8220;How
nice you look, you darling! I hope they&#8217;ll
come before you crumple the pinafore and
make yourself untidy again. There, now,
don&#8217;t put the brush-handle in your mouth,
or you&#8217;ll make yourself ill as you did before.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at him, then held
her breath and listened, for she thought she
heard an exclamation in Bessie&#8217;s voice. An
instant&#8217;s pause, and this was followed by a
rush of feet into the passage, for the two
little girls had been watching from the window,
and here were the expected arrivals at
last. Her heart beat fast, but she stood still,
listening. Had they returned with or without
father?</p>

<p><i>With!</i> There was his voice! Madge
snatched the baby from the chair on which
she had placed him while she improved his
personal appearance, and, kissing him ecstatically
in her delight, she darted down the
stairs as fast as she dared with such a
burden.</p>

<p>At last! At last! There was her father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
just inside the door, looking exactly the same
as ever, with his old smile, and the shiny
bald place on his head, and the dear shabby
old brown coat. There he was, hugging each
child in turn, and then stopping to take her
and the baby both into his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s Madgie, then!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;How are you, old woman? And here&#8217;s the
young scamp that&#8217;s been frightening you all
so much;&#8221; and he took the baby from her,
and carried him into the sitting-room.
&#8220;Looks a little pale still, the young monkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Close behind, and following him in, came
Mrs. Kayll laughing, and trying to hide the
fact that she was crying at the same time.
And after her came Jack, who kept rather in
the background, and was very silent and
quiet in the midst of the joyous confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here I am again,&#8221; said Mr. Kayll,
when the kissing and shaking of hands and
general embracing were over, as he sat down
on a box with the baby on one knee, Bessie
on the other, and Edie with her arms round
his neck from behind. &#8220;And time, too, I
think. Nice goings-on your mother&#8217;s been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
telling me about. I see you&#8217;re not fit to be
trusted without me. In one week you&#8217;ve
made the baby very ill, pulled the house
down, and drowned the furniture!&#8221;</p>

<p>The children laughed, and poured into his
ear a stream of information about the storm,
and one thing and another, until he was
nearly deafened, and announced that he was
very hungry and wanted his tea, on which
everyone else was discovered to be hungry
too, and they settled down to that meal while
the bustle subsided.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Kayll asked a hundred questions,
which everybody answered at once, so that
he found it difficult to understand any of the
replies. After which it became his turn to
be questioned, and to tell his adventures from
the very beginning, describing how he had
been taken to the police-cell, while the true
thieves got away scot-free.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I really think,&#8221; he said in conclusion,
&#8220;that in spite of everything the owner of
that shop still believes me to be the real
burglar, and a most desperate character into
the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>At which they all laughed as though it
were the best joke in the world. And the
more they looked at the simple kind-hearted
cheery little man, the more amusing it seemed.
Even Mrs. Kayll, who had almost forgotten
how to smile during the past week, laughed
till the tears came into her eyes again, and
startled the baby so much by such an unwonted
proceeding, that he puckered up his
face for a cry, and had to be comforted, and
kissed, and fed with spoonfuls of tea from his
father&#8217;s cup until he recovered his spirits.</p>

<p>Soon after Jem came in, and then Bob,
entering nervously, uncertain whether there
was pleasure or sorrow in store, and then
hurrahing for joy. And, of course, everything
had to be explained again, so that there
was little pause from talking until it grew
late, and the younger ones had to go to bed.</p>

<p>Before he said good-night, Jack found an
opportunity to speak to his father aside.
His voice was rather unsteady as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, it was my fault. I am so sorry
I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not get out another word, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
turned away his head with a sob. His father
signed to Bob, who was the only other occupant
of the room, to leave them, which he at
once did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Jack,&#8221; said he quietly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
quite understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was that miserable two pounds,&#8221; the
boy began, and then he could keep back the
tears and sobs no longer, and had a hearty
cry. Mr. Kayll laid his hand on his son&#8217;s
shoulder, and waited till he was calmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Jack!&#8221; he said then, half smiling,
not so much from amusement, as because he
was touched. He had never imagined his
mischievous, laughing, careless Jack, who
never seemed to have a softer side, taking
this to heart as his own fault.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not angry?&#8221; the boy whispered,
still with his hands over his face.</p>

<p>Mr. Kayll did not reply, but stooped and
kissed him on the forehead. Jack looked up
in astonishment; he had never received such
a caress since he was old enough to wear
trousers&mdash;then he flung his arm round his
father&#8217;s neck, kissed him back again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
dashed out of the room and out of the house,
knowing there would be no solitude for him
upstairs.</p>

<p>Some time after, having walked off all
traces of his weakness, he came back in the
best of spirits, and feeling an intense desire
to put a hair-brush in Jem&#8217;s bed, or some
cobbler&#8217;s wax in one of his boots. But he
restrained himself, for he had vowed inwardly
never to play another practical joke,
however harmless it might seem, and on
the whole he kept to his resolution thenceforth.</p>

<p>Not that Jem ever again gave him so much
provocation to tease him as he used a short
time ago. The younger boy was quite altered,
though no one knew what a shock he had
received, for neither then nor later did he
allude to what he had felt when he found
himself alone in the flooded house. Yet it
was plain that he was changed, and for the
better. He said less and worked more in
the future, and proved so steady and industrious
in his new place, that his employer
raised his wages again and again.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8220;The darkest hour comes just before the
dawn,&#8221; Mrs. Kayll used often to say afterwards,
when she looked back upon that week
of troubles; for, though they all had to work
hard, to economize, and to deny themselves
many little pleasures for a long time, they
were able to keep out of debt, and by slow
degrees to furnish once more a home of their
own.</p>

<p>There was hardly one among these seven
children, unless it were the baby, who was
too young to understand, who had not learned
more in those few days of disaster than in
many months when the course of their life
was smoother. Madge had grown wiser than
to think again that those who talk the most
of their affection, will prove to possess more
than those who are less demonstrative, when
the trial comes. Bob had learned not only
to be strong, and to act for those younger
and weaker than himself, but also to be
tender and patient with the little ones.
Jack had given up amusing himself at the
expense of other people. Jem could not
often thenceforward deceive himself into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
belief that he was doing what was best for
others, when he was really only gratifying
his own selfish wishes. Edie and Bessie had
been taught to make themselves of use in
the house, instead of playing or idling while
Madge did all the drudgery, and scarcely had
a moment in which to rest.</p>

<p>With all these lessons learned by heart,
the children, big and little, could not fail to
be happier than of old. They understood
each other&#8217;s value better, and loved each
other more, so that they were more lenient
to one another&#8217;s failings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coleson brought Amy up to London
at intervals of a few months to see them; for
the little girl&#8217;s plan was realized, and she
and her mother and sisters lived in the most
countrified of country places, where everything
was fresh and sweet, and the air was
pure, and, instead of smelling of smoke,
was laden with the scent of flowers. Here
the youngest child had learned to walk at
last, and was growing healthier day by day,
while little Kitty was becoming a sturdy
brown-cheeked rustic girl, and Amy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
acquiring round cheeks, tinged with rose-colour.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Coleson used always to look with
wonder on her cousin&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it,&#8221; she would ask, &#8220;that, in
spite of the London atmosphere and everything,
you all look so healthy, strong, and
bright?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mr. Kayll would answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because we all work hard, and don&#8217;t
make ourselves unhappy about little troubles,
for we know what great ones are like.&#8221;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
